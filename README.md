# baacke-adam-portfolio

## Description


- I wanted to test my limits of my html and css coding. at the same time i wanted to have a live document that would show my progress as a programer.
- I  started with a simple wrieframe drawing to organize my thoughts. I then sectioned off the nessary elements to at least get the page some what presentable. 
- through this I learned i gained more experance in useing flex on a page and my current limits of knowldge of how to properly utilize it. i also learned how to better fomate pictures and inline links into them.
- my goal is to revisit this later to polish and properly fulfil the requirments.
